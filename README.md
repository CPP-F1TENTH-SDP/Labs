# Cal Poly Pomona F1TENTH Project
Welcome to Cal Poly Pomona's F1TENTH SDP Group. This is where we posted our code related to the labs and lectures posted on the official F1TENTH GitHub [page](https://github.com/f1tenth). 


## Labs
The original lab assignments are from [F1TENTH](https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_labs_openrepo).
Each of the labs correspond to each respective file that we work on and corresponds to the F1TENTH project. 
There are 9 labs in total. 
### Lab 1: Introduction to ROS2 
This is where you'll install and initalize the F1TENTH simulation based on Docker Desktop. 
See the **[F1TENTH Gym ROS - Install Guide](https://github.com/CPP-F1TENTH-SDP/Labs#f1tenth-gym-ros---install-guide)** for more information.
### Lab 2: Safety Node 
This is where we create a file in which the driving vehicle will automatically stop before it crashes when driving. 
### Lab 3: Wall Follow 
This is where we design a file so that the driving vehicle will be able to follow along a centerpoint when between two walls. 
### Lab 4: Gap Follow 
This is where we design a file in order for the vehicle to avoid obstacles while following a centerpoint via Lab 3. 
### Lab 5: Scanning 
This lab is meant to allow the vehicle to run itself without a map. 
As of March 4, 2024, we'll not be able to conduct this lab as it requires a camera and we don't have such camera on our F1TENTH vehicle. 
### Lab 6: Pure Pursuit 
The lab is meant to greatly improve the vehicle's speed efficiency by picking and updating a goalpoint and following that goalpoint. 
### Lab 7

### Lab 8 

### Lab 9
