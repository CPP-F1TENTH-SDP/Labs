# Cal Poly Pomona F1TENTH Project: Labs and Simulation Install 
Welcome to Cal Poly Pomona's F1TENTH SDP Group. This is where we posted our code related to the labs and lectures posted on the official F1TENTH GitHub [page](https://github.com/f1tenth). 


## Labs
The original lab assignments are from [F1TENTH](https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_labs_openrepo).
Each of the labs correspond to each respective file that we work on and corresponds to the F1TENTH project. 
Currently, there are 9 labs that we either have worked on or will be working on in the future. 

### [Lab 1: Introduction to ROS2](https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_lab1_template/tree/24f7320ebf1b9a325a2039d4208204da4454d1ab)
This is where you'll install and initalize the F1TENTH simulation based on Docker Desktop.
Please see the **[F1TENTH Gym ROS - Install Guide](https://github.com/CPP-F1TENTH-SDP/Labs/wiki/F1TENTH-Gym-ROS-%E2%80%90-Install-Guide)** for more information.

### [Lab 2: Safety Node](https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_lab2_template/tree/b49965fb833221c6ba0f83666838c6f9f9971438)
This is where we create a file in which the driving vehicle will automatically stop before it crashes when driving.\
This lab is **complete** as of April 22, 2024.
Please see the **[Node Launch](https://github.com/CPP-F1TENTH-SDP/Labs/wiki/Node-Launch#lab-2---safety_node)** for more information on how to install and run Lab 2. 

### [Lab 3: Wall Follow](https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_lab3_template/tree/62a7a3d687d00ba1dd25cf7025c13a623bafdb5b)
This is where we design a file so that the driving vehicle will be able to follow along a centerpoint when between two walls.\
This lab is **complete** as of April 22, 2024. 
Please see the **[Node Launch](https://github.com/CPP-F1TENTH-SDP/Labs/wiki/Node-Launch#lab-3---wall_follow)** for more information on how to install and run Lab 3. 

### [Lab 4: Gap Follow](https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_lab4_template/tree/22a1c490759f05d822efae10d353415fbb187b24)
This is where we design a file in order for the vehicle to avoid obstacles while following a centerpoint via Lab 3.\
This lab is **incomplete** as of April 22, 2024.

If you wish to help contribute to this lab, then please see the **[Node Launch](https://github.com/CPP-F1TENTH-SDP/Labs/wiki/Node-Launch#lab-4---gap_follow)** for \
more information on how to install and run Lab 4. 

### [Lab 5: Scanning](https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_lab5_template/tree/189bc1160edd6a265b419dd9eccf1b8739530047)
This lab is meant to allow the vehicle to run itself without a map.\
As of March 4, 2024, we'll not be able to conduct this lab as it requires a camera and we don't have such camera on our F1TENTH vehicle.

### [Lab 6: Pure Pursuit](https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_lab6_template/tree/4a664036044b763b97c34e2018246772cf0699de)
This lab is meant to greatly improve the vehicle's speed efficiency by picking and updating a goalpoint and following that goalpoint.\
As of March 6, 2024, this lab is WIP. 

### [Lab 7: Motion Planning](https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_lab7_template/tree/0abac8b18db1f7078a973fc4057aed7cf64b7d97)
This lab is meant to provide the vehicle with some key algorithms in a one-on-one race with another vehicle.\
As of March 6, 2024, this lab has not been started. 

### [Lab 8: Computer Vision](https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_lab8_template/tree/41ff6ada95653b1ef9a63dc7bedd050a6fec6b34)
This lab's purpose is to implement the F1TENTH's camera system into our existing self-autonomous system.\
As of March 6, 2024, this lab has not been started, and requires a camera.\
As our F1TENTH vehicle doesn't have a camera, it's unlikely that we'll be able to conduct this lab. 

### [Lab 9: Model Predictive Control](https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_lab9_template/tree/752cd1df490adf249cfd3f88d9ac5475c72655f6)
Related to control systems, this lab is meant to predict the vehicle's future state.\
As of March 6, 2024, this lab has not been started.
